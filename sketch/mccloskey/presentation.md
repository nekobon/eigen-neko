# Conclusion - John
- Simple works decently
- Eyes and Least Squares give much better eigenfaces
- The number of components needed to account for all the noise stays consistent
# Future Directions
- Use distance from each eigenvector as labels to train a model that would then classify cats into prospective types (to decompose our own cats)
- Use clustering to cluster groups of cats in the first few PCA dimensions and fine commonalities
